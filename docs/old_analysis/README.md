# Old Analysis Artifacts

This folder contains historical analysis artifacts from the design phase. These documents were used to inform the final implementation guide but have been superseded by the consolidated documentation.

## Files

- **IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md** - Original implementation plan (before data analysis)
- **DATA_FINDINGS.md** - Raw data analysis findings
- **REVISED_SCHEMA.md** - Detailed schema design with examples
- **analysis-results.txt** - Raw DuckDB query output
- **parquet-compression-results.txt** - Parquet compression test results

## Current Documentation

See the parent `docs/` directory for current documentation:
- **docs/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md** - Consolidated implementation reference
- **docs/DATA_ANALYSIS.md** - Critical analysis with design decisions

These files are kept for historical reference only. Do not use for implementation - refer to the current documentation instead.
