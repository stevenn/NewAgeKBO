# Session Notes - October 25, 2025

## Summary

This session completed the temporal query refactor and discovered a data quality issue with Extract 157.

## Completed Work

### 1. Temporal Query Fix - COMPLETED ✅

**Problem**: Point-in-time queries were using `_extract_number = N` instead of `_extract_number <= N`, causing empty results for incremental updates.

**Solution Implemented**:
- ✅ Added `_deleted_at_extract` column to all temporal tables (migration: `scripts/add-deletion-tracking.ts`)
- ✅ Updated deletion tracking in `scripts/apply-daily-update.ts`
- ✅ Created temporal query helpers in `lib/motherduck/temporal-query.ts`
- ✅ Refactored `lib/motherduck/enterprise-detail.ts` to use new helpers
- ✅ Updated API routes to use `TemporalFilter` object interface
- ✅ Refreshed database views with `scripts/create-views.ts`
- ✅ **Testing passed**: Enterprise 0878.689.049 at Extract 150 correctly returns data from Extract 140

**Test Script**: `scripts/test-temporal-query.ts`

### 2. Snapshot Navigation Improvements - COMPLETED ✅

**Fixed Issues**:
- ✅ Snapshots dropdown now shows ALL extracts with data (not just where enterprise record exists)
- ✅ Only the most recent extract is marked as "Current" (fixed `_is_current` aggregation logic)
- ✅ Fixed initial load and switching between snapshots (removed early return condition)
- ✅ Simplified data flow: always fetch detail when snapshot changes

**Files Modified**:
- `app/api/enterprises/[number]/snapshots/route.ts` - UNION query across all tables
- `app/admin/browse/[number]/page.tsx` - Fixed useEffect dependencies

### 3. Comparison UI Display Fix - COMPLETED ✅

**Problem**: Removed items weren't being displayed (only "added" items were shown)

**Solution**:
- Display order now: Removed (red) → Unchanged → Added (green)
- Applied to all sections: denominations, addresses, activities, contacts, establishments
- Removed items are explicitly rendered from `comparison.removed` array

**Files Modified**: `app/admin/browse/[number]/page.tsx`

### 4. Extract Number Verification - COMPLETED ✅

**Confirmed**: No hardcoded extract numbers in logic
- System uses `ExtractType` metadata field from CSV
- Extract 140 references in code are comments/documentation only
- One filename filter in `scripts/batch-apply-updates.ts` (non-critical)

## Data Quality Issue Discovered ⚠️

### Enterprise 0721.700.388 - Address Discrepancy

**Official KBO Site Shows**:
- Registered seat: Barnumerf 8, 8800 Roeselare
- "Since September 4, 2025"

**Our Database Shows**:
- Extract 140 (Oct 4): Noordstraat 52 box 33, 8800 Roeselare
- Extract 150 (Oct 14): Barnumerf 8, 8800 Roeselare ✅ (matches official)
- Extract 157 (Oct 21): Kerkstraat 20, 8830 Hooglede ❌ (contradicts official)

**Analysis**:
- Extract 157 is marked as `_is_current = true`
- All addresses are type REGO (registered office) for the enterprise (no establishments)
- Extract 157 appears to have incorrect/corrupted data
- Extract 150's Barnumerf address is the correct one per official KBO

**Possible Causes**:
1. Source file corruption in KboOpenData_0157 ZIP
2. Temporary change in Extract 157 that was reverted in later extracts (160+)
3. Data processing error during import

**Action Items for Later**:
- [ ] Check source KboOpenData_0157 ZIP file for address data
- [ ] Re-import Extract 157 from source
- [ ] Import Extracts 160+ to see if address corrects back to Barnumerf
- [ ] Investigate if this affects other enterprises in Extract 157
- [ ] Consider adding data validation checks during import

## Test Enterprises for Future Work

### Enterprises with Temporal Changes

**Address Changes**:
- **0721.700.388** - 3 address changes across extracts [140, 150, 157] ⚠️ Has data quality issue
- **0778.976.712** - Changes in [140, 156, 158]
- **0627.620.088** - Changes in [140, 145, 156]

**Denomination Changes**:
- **0801.668.871** - Changes in [140, 150, 156]
- **0533.711.618** - Changes in [140, 146, 149]
- **0787.802.821** - Changes in [140, 148, 155]

**Header Field Changes** (for testing yellow "Changed" indicators):

**Juridical Form Changes**:
- **0598.790.106** - 612 → 610 between Extract 140 and 144
- **0432.881.009** - 015 → 610 between Extract 140 and 149
- **0502.729.818** - 011 → 610 between Extract 140 and 145
- **0447.712.606** - 015 → 610 between Extract 140 and 151
- **0524.915.104** - 012 → 610 between Extract 140 and 158

**Type of Enterprise Change**:
- **1013.327.821** - Type "2" → "1" between Extract 140 and 149

**Juridical Situation Changes**:
- **0682.652.742** - 000 → 013 between Extract 140 and 150
- **0672.697.572** - 000 → 012 between Extract 140 and 152
- **0672.704.205** - 000 → 050 between Extract 140 and 143

- **0845.347.476** - 000 → 012 between Extract 140 and 142

### Test Enterprise for Bug Fix Validation
- **0878.689.049** - Perfect for testing temporal query fix (has denomination in Extract 140, no changes in Extract 150)

## Database Status

**Current State**:
- Highest extract number: **159** (Oct 23, 2025)
- All extracts 140-159 imported
- All extracts have `_is_current = true` records (this is expected - each extract marks its own records as current)
- Deletion tracking column added to all tables

## Scripts Created During Session

**Diagnostic/Testing Scripts**:
- `scripts/find-changed-enterprises.ts` - Find enterprises with changes across extracts
- `scripts/check-enterprise-snapshots.ts` - Check snapshot availability
- `scripts/compare-addresses-detail.ts` - Compare address data in detail
- `scripts/test-temporal-query.ts` - Test temporal query fix
- `scripts/find-field-changes.ts` - Find header field changes
- `scripts/check-extract-metadata.ts` - Check extract metadata
- `scripts/test-temporal-address-query.ts` - Test temporal address queries
- `scripts/test-current-api.ts` - Test API responses

## Files Modified

**Core Temporal Query Implementation**:
- `scripts/add-deletion-tracking.ts` (created)
- `scripts/apply-daily-update.ts` (modified deletion tracking)
- `lib/motherduck/temporal-query.ts` (created)
- `lib/motherduck/enterprise-detail.ts` (refactored)
- `app/api/enterprises/[number]/route.ts` (updated to TemporalFilter)
- `app/api/enterprises/[number]/snapshots/route.ts` (updated to TemporalFilter, improved snapshot detection)

**UI Improvements**:
- `app/admin/browse/[number]/page.tsx` (fixed comparison display, fixed useEffect logic)

**Documentation**:
- `TEMPORAL_QUERY_FIX.md` (updated status)

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Priority**:
   - Investigate Extract 157 data quality issue with enterprise 0721.700.388
   - Check if other enterprises in Extract 157 have similar issues

2. **Testing**:
   - Test comparison UI with enterprises that have actual changes (use test list above)
   - Verify yellow "Changed" indicators appear for header field changes

3. **Future Enhancements**:
   - Consider showing "Modified" (orange) instead of "Removed+Added" for changed collection items
   - Add data validation checks during import process
   - Create automated tests for temporal query logic

## Technical Notes

**Temporal Query Logic**:
```sql
-- For point-in-time at Extract N:
WHERE _extract_number <= N
  AND (_deleted_at_extract IS NULL OR _deleted_at_extract > N)

-- Then use ROW_NUMBER() to get latest version:
ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
  PARTITION BY id
  ORDER BY _extract_number DESC, _snapshot_date DESC
)
```

**Important**: Window functions require selecting from `sub` table, not the original table alias.

## Known Issues

1. **Extract 157 Data Quality**: Enterprise 0721.700.388 shows incorrect address (Kerkstraat instead of Barnumerf)
2. **No Status Changes Found**: The test query found no status changes across all extracts (might be expected if no enterprises changed status in this period)

## Branch Status

Branch: `feat/phase-3-admin-web-ui`
Ready for: Code review and further testing
